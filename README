How to Use
----------
Move the cursor around and press enter a couple times to add points to the rollercoaster, after the third point is selected, the track will generate.

What remains to be done
-----------------------
-Fix a bug with the rollercoaster track drawing
-Create the coaster and have it move along the track
-Allow the camera to be on the coaster in first person view
-Add trees to the ground
-Fix camera angles
-Particles when coaster accelerates/brakes

I think for the most part, the most difficult part is getting the track to draw 100% correctly since I use 3 point Bezier curve points and then find the offset on both sides to draw the rails. Once that is fixed, the rest should be less math intensive and more just drawing things.
