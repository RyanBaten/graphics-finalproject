w             increase velocity
s             decrease velocity

Construction mode specific controls:
Key           Action
---           ------
w             move camera forward
s             move camera backward
i             move cursor forward
k             move cursor back
j             move cursor left 
l             move cursor right
t             move cursor up 
y             move cursor down 
Enter         add point for rollercoaster
r             reset rollercoaster points

How to Use
----------
When the program starts up, it will load in and display a sample track. I would recommend playing with the basic controls (arrow keys and w and s keys) to look around and change the velocity of the coaster on the track. Next, press the 4 key to enter a fun first person mode where you ride the coaster!

The construction mode can be entered by pressing the 1 key. Move the cursor around and press enter a couple times to add points to the rollercoaster, after the third point is selected, the generated track will be desplayed. Add additional sections by pressing enter again. It is helpful to use the w and s keys to move the camera back and forth when trying to get a good view of the scene.

Have fun!
